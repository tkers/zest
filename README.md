# 🍋 Zest

> A web runtime for [Pulp](https://play.date/pulp/about) games

Zest is a new way to play and distribute games made with Pulp. It's build from
the ground up (without using Panic's proprietary code) so that developers can
use it to make their games available to more players.

This project is still in active development, so don't expect your game to be
fully compatible just yet. However, games that use no PulpScript (i.e. only use
the default dialog options for sprites and items), should already be working!

Support for sound and music are not yet implemented, and inputs like the crank
and accelerometer will probably be out of scope for the first release.
